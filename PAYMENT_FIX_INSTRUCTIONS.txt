URGENT FIX FOR REACT HOOKS ERROR
==================================

You need to make 2 changes in: app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx

STEP 1: Find line 140 (it says):
  const [selectedDepositDetails, setSelectedDepositDetails] = useState<PaymentRequest | null>(null);

STEP 2: Add a NEW LINE right after it (line 141):
  const [paymentSubTab, setPaymentSubTab] = useState<"deposits" | "withdrawals">("deposits");

So lines 140-142 should look like:
  const [selectedDepositDetails, setSelectedDepositDetails] = useState<PaymentRequest | null>(null);
  const [paymentSubTab, setPaymentSubTab] = useState<"deposits" | "withdrawals">("deposits");

  const router = useRouter();

STEP 3: Find line 1001 (around line 1000-1003, inside "if (activeTab === "payments")"):
      const [paymentSubTab, setPaymentSubTab] = useState<"deposits" | "withdrawals">("deposits");

STEP 4: DELETE that entire line AND the empty line after it.

After deletion, lines 1000-1003 should look like:
    if (activeTab === "payments") {
      return (
        <div className="mt-6 space-y-6">

---

WHY THIS FIXES IT:
React hooks MUST be at the top level of the component, NOT inside if statements.
Moving useState to the top fixes the "change in order of Hooks" error.

SAVE THE FILE and the error will disappear!
